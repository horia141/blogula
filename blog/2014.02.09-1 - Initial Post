This is the first post. Not much more to add, I suppose, until the first proper article is written.

This blog is build by Blogula, which is a static blog generator tool I've developed. You can check it out in the projects page.

Some heading text for the list:
* Hello world
* Alla X

Some formula here:
%formula{
J_\alpha(x) = \sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m + \alpha + 1)}{\left({\frac{x}{2}}\right)}^{2 m + \alpha}
}

Some heading text for the code:
%code{C++}{
size_t
code_image_new_geometry(
    size_t                    row_count,
    size_t                    col_count,
    size_t                    word_count,
    enum polarity_split_type  polarity_split_type,
    size_t                    reduce_spread) {
    size_t  aftcoding_row_count;
    size_t  aftcoding_col_count;
    size_t  polarity_split_multiplier;
    size_t  aftreduce_row_count;
    size_t  aftreduce_col_count;

    aftcoding_row_count = row_count - (row_count % reduce_spread);
    aftcoding_col_count = col_count - (col_count % reduce_spread);

    if (polarity_split_type == NONE) {
	polarity_split_multiplier = 1;
    } else if (polarity_split_type == NO_SIGN || polarity_split_type == KEEP_SIGN) {
	polarity_split_multiplier = 2;
    } else {
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    aftreduce_row_count = aftcoding_row_count / reduce_spread;
    aftreduce_col_count = aftcoding_col_count / reduce_spread;

    return polarity_split_multiplier * aftreduce_row_count * aftreduce_col_count * word_count;
}
}
