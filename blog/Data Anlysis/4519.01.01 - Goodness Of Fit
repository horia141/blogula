=== Goodness Of Fit Tests ===

define {Goodness-of-Fit tests for one variable $X$} {
  * We ssume $X \distas \mathcal{X}[\mu,\sigma]$.
    * Graphical: 
      * Draw a histogram. Estimate $\mu$ as $\hat{\mu}$ and $\sigma$ as $\hat{\sigma}$ and overlay the theoretical $\mathcal{N}[\hat{mu}, \hat{\sigma}]$ graph. Ascertain normality.
      * Q-Q Plot.
}

define {Q-Q Plot} {
  A plot used for sample-distribution, sample-sample and distribution-distribution comparisions, which shows in a graphical and intuitive way, how good a fit there is between the two distributions.
  For sample-distribution. Order the sample and compute quantiles for each observation. These will be $1/n, 2/n, \dots, n/n$ (depending on computing method though). Then, compute theoretical quantiles, that is, the value from the distribution which is larger than $i/n$ of the other values. We now have a set of pairs, which we plot. We're building a parametric curve in the space $D^2$ indexed by $q \in [0,1]$. If the sample comes from the distribution, the resulting curve should actually be the straight line $y=x$. We'll see problems, of course, and we can get a feeling for the differences of the actual population distribution and the one we think it is.
  For sample-sample the procedure is similar, only a sorting and paring is necessary. If the two samples have different sizes, interpolation might be necessary, but it's already tricky.
  Finally distribution-distribution is more flexible, but if the CDFs are not continuous, we must be careful - do interpolations.
  A typical Q-Q plot tests a sample against the standard normal (which has readily computed quantiles). The sample must be normalized for a fair comparison, so we must compute Z-scores first.
